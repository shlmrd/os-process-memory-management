The assignments illustrate and explore all areas of modern operating
systems, including threads and concurrency, multiprogramming,
system calls, virtual memory, software-loaded TLB's, file systems,
network protocols, remote procedure call, and distributed systems.

Highlights :
- Threading and synchronization primitives
- User program support and exception handling
- MIPS-like machine simulator

Build :
Requirements: GNU make, g++, and a POSIX shell (Linux, macOS, or WSL).

From the repo root:
  cd code
  make

If you are on a new platform, adjust `code/Makefile.dep` so the host
detection matches your system. The helper scripts in `bin/` are used
during the build and should remain executable.

Run :
Threads:
  cd code/threads
  ./nachos

User programs:
  cd code/userprog
  ./nachos -x ../test/test_file

Repository layout :
- code/threads: kernel threads and synchronization
- code/userprog: user program support
- code/test: sample user programs
- code/bin: build tools for Nachos utilities
